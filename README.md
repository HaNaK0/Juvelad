# Juvelad

A small personal project made with Löve2d. The intention is to make a small game that can be made over a short duration.
The game is most likely going to end up being a bejeweld clone and hence the name "juvelad" wich is bad translation of the word bejeweld into swedish
It is made fore löve version 11.3, to run the game you can download the engine and find instructions on their webpage https://love2d.org/
